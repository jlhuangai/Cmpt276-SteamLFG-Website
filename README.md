SteamLFG is a website designed to help users find people to play games with. Users
can sign up/login to keep track of hours played, interact with other users, and maintain a healthy
gaming lifestyle. Furthermore, the app aims to encourage healthy habits related to video
gaming. Specifically, it tackles the wide-spread issue, video-game addiction, which SteamLFG
attempts to remedy through goal-setting, daily monitoring of hours played, and suggests tips to
achieve better lifestyle habits (related to video gaming). Additionally, the website incentivizes
healthy habits through achievements and profile level.

The customers/target audience will be users of Steam who are looking for a new game
to play or who are looking for new people to play with in a game they already play. Furthermore,
the website entices health-minded individuals who would like to play video games whilst
maintaining a productive lifestyle.

Currently there are many apps that are either specifically for finding other players, or
apps related to setting healthy habits. However, SteamLFG aims to combine the two to target
video-game addiction. Currently Steam players looking for other people to play with must
download an app on their phone, this inconvenience may discourage users. With SteamLFG no
download is needed. SteamLFG is targeted towards any user that plays multiplayer games on
steam, even users that are not looking for a group to play with can use the website to increase
productivity by monitoring hours played.

The main features that SteamLFG offers are the ability to match users with similar
preferences together and encourage healthy habits through positive reinforcement by granting
achievements and other rewards. Specifically, players will be able to search for other players
playing a similar video game (whether it be by genre, profile, skill level, etc.) and other groups
as well.

The Healthy Game Habits System (HGHS) will condition users to practice healthy
habits and analyze user data to give supportive tips. Every user will have a profile that increases
in level through gaining achievements (by completing weekly health goals, being active in
groups etc.). SteamLFG will use the Steam API to get player data in accordance with games 
played and apply said data for matching users and health. Moreover, the Discord API will be
used to allow gamers versatility in accessing SteamLFG stats.

In the first iteration of SteamLFG the website will allow users to sign up/login to share
preferences and/or favourite games. Alongside this the app's initial layout will be created, with
traversable pages. Furthermore, user profiles will be created with saved stats and interests.
Users will also be able to join/create new groups to allow players to socialize and play together.
For the first iteration, if Bob were to head to the website, he would be greeted with a
Login/Sign Up page. Bob will have the option to login if he already has an account, or he can
sign up and create a new account. Upon choosing the sign-up option, Bob will be asked for his
email, and he will create a username and password for SteamLFG. After Bob has created his
account, he will be asked to choose his gaming preferences from a list of categories. After
listing his preferences, Bob will also be able to create a group.
